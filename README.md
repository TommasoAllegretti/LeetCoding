# LeetCoding

The goal of this repository is to collect and organize various writeups from LeetCode challenges, describing my reasoning and workflow in order to review my effort to get better at solving DSA problems.

This is to be considered a amateurish perspective on problem solving and not a guide to solve LeetCode problems in the most optimal way. 

## Folder Structure

Folders are organized per arguments (e.g. arrays, sorting, DP, etc.), inside each folder there will be three folders to categorize the problems by difficulty (easy, medium and hard).

## Progamming Language

I will use Javascript as it's the main programming language I currently use at work.

Might pick up a different language for learning purpose.
